We are going to detect brain tumor using matlab and basic knowledge of image processing.
We will use concept of solidity and thresholding.
The repository contains the source code in matlab for brain tumor detection.
For better understanding I include source code and MRI image in a file.
You have to download this file and run "brain.m".
After running this you will get a GUI popup window.
After this simply you have to upload mri image and tap the detect icon.
